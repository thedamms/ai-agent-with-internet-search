# No Comments Rule

Code should be self-documenting through clear naming conventions. Comments are not allowed as they often become outdated and can be misleading.

## Pattern
```regex
#.*$
```

## Severity
error

## Example
```python
# Bad
def process(x):  # processes the input
    return x * 2

# Good
def double_input_value(input_value):
    return input_value * 2
```

## Rationale
- Comments can become outdated and misleading
- Self-documenting code is more maintainable
- Clear naming conventions make code more readable
- Reduces cognitive load by eliminating redundant information
